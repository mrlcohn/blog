    <h2>Welcome to my very first blog post!</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Leonard. I am a DevOps engineer who wants to build projects to
      develop my skills and learn more about the technologies I use at work and
      those that are popular in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my current position, my team uses the MERN stack, and I sometimes feel
      intimidated by the codebase. I want to learn more about building and
      deploying this stack so I can jump in and learn more about the products I
      am supporting. We use AWS for some of our development and QA deployments,
      but our production deployments are bare-metal. I want to explore AWS
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my first project, I am going to set up a blog that I can use to
      document my projects and hone my DevOps skills. The blog will involve the
      following components:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>MongoDB</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Deploy</li>
        <ul>
          <li>AWS DocumentDB</li>
          <li>AWS MongoDB Atlas integration</li>
          <li>Self-hosted DB hosted on AWS infrastructure</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Document structure of blog posts and users</li>
        <li>CRUD operations for blog posts</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Express.js</li>
      <ul>
        <li>API to fetch data from database</li>
        <li>Authorization and authentication</li>
      </ul>
      <li>React.js</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Routing to homepage, login, upload, and blog post pages</li>
        <li>Integration of Material UI components</li>
        <li>Basic style (CSS) configurations</li>
        <li>Vite.js (used by my current employer)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Node.js</li>
      <li>DevOps</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Use as many AWS tools as possible</li>
        <li>Implement Infrastructure-as-Code</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Terraform</li>
          <li>AWS CloudFormation</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Implement Configuration-as-Code</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ansible</li>
          <li>Chef</li>
          <li>Puppet</li>
          <li>AWS</li>
        </ul>
        <li>CI/CD pipeline management</li>
        <ul>
          <li>AWS tools</li>
          <li>Jenkins server</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Test integration</li>
        <li>Hosting through Docker and AWS ECS or EKS</li>
        <li>Branching strategy and GitHub repository</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>
      That list is fairly long but doable. I wanted to get the major goals out
      in the open so that I do not encounter too much scope creep right away.
      I have other projects in my head that I also want to tackle that will
      expand on these concepts. I plan to write at least one post as I
      implement each of these concepts.

    <h2>First steps - GitHub, index.html, and AWS</h2>
    <p>
      I started by creating a new GitHub repository. You can find it
      <a href="https://github.com/mrlcohn/blog">here</a>! It is pretty bare
      right now, but I will be improving on it with multiple changes as I build
      this project. Right now, it looks like this:
